# HealthCare Appointment Booking

Program serves as a simple appointment management system for
doctors and patients, enabling efficient scheduling and reminders. Users can
easily input appointment details, check doctor availability, and manage patient
records for a seamless healthcare experience.

It is a simple appointment management system designed for doctors
and patients. It allows doctors to manage their schedules, check appointment
availability, and send reminders to both doctors and patients. 

# Key points in the project :

1) Class Structure : 
The program utilizes object-oriented programming
principles with classes representing Admin, Doctor, and Patient. The
Doctor and Patient classes inherit properties from the Admin class.

2) Appointment Management :
 - Doctors can check their availability for a given appointment time, confirm
appointments, and delete them if necessary.
 - Patients can be added to the system, and their appointment details are stored.

3) User Interaction : 
The program prompts the user to enter appointment
details, patient information, and choose options for managing
appointments through a text-based interface.

4) Reminders : 
The system can send reminders to both the doctor and the
patients about their scheduled appointments.

Overall, this program provides a foundational structure for managing medical
appointments.
